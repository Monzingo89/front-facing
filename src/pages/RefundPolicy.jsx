      <p>
        At VCV, we are committed to delivering high-quality and professional card grading services. Your satisfaction is important to us, and we aim to be as transparent and fair as possible with our refund and return process.
      </p>

      <h2 style={{ color: '#b682ff', marginTop: '1.5rem' }}>Refunds</h2>
      <p>
        You may request a refund for your order <strong>before the grading process begins</strong>. Once grading has started and your card has been encapsulated in a tamper-evident VCV case, <strong>no refunds can be issued</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Refunds will be processed to the original payment method within 5â€“7 business days of approval.
      </p>

      <h2 style={{ color: '#b682ff', marginTop: '1.5rem' }}>Returns</h2>
      <p>
        Due to the custom and irreversible nature of grading, we do not accept returns on completed graded cards.
      </p>

        If your item arrives damaged or there is a labeling error, please contact us within 7 days of delivery. We will investigate and provide a resolution as appropriate.
